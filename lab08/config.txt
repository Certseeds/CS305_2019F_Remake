# loopback packets can only be filtered using 'outbound'.
localhost ipv4 all: outbound and ip.DstAddr >= 127.0.0.1 and ip.DstAddr <= 127.255.255.255
localhost ipv4 tcp: tcp and outbound and ip.DstAddr >= 127.0.0.1 and ip.DstAddr <= 127.255.255.255

# more general
all sending packets: outbound
all receiving packets: inbound

# more specific
all ipv4 against specific ip: ip.DstAddr == 198.51.100.1 or ip.SrcAddr == 198.51.100.1
tcp ipv4 against specific ip: tcp and (ip.DstAddr == 198.51.100.1 or ip.SrcAddr == 198.51.100.1)
udp ipv4 against specific ip: udp and (ip.DstAddr == 198.51.100.1 or ip.SrcAddr == 198.51.100.1)
all ipv4 against port: ip.DstPort == 12354 or ip.SrcPort == 12354 
tcp ipv4 against port: tcp and (tcp.DstPort == 12354 or tcp.SrcPort == 12354)
udp ipv4 against port: udp and (udp.DstPort == 12354 or udp.SrcPort == 12354)

# ipv6 is supported but usually not that useful
ipv6 all: ipv6

# you can add your usual filters here for your own use:
#http requests ONLY(data transmit on other ports): outbound and tcp.DstPort == 80
